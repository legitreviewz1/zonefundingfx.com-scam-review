  <p class="warning">‚ö† WARNING: Zonefundingfx.com is NOT a licensed or trusted broker!</p>

  <p>
    If you're considering investing with <strong>Zonefundingfx.com</strong>, stop immediately. This platform has been identified as an <strong>unlicensed scam broker</strong> that is deceiving users, especially beginners in online trading. Victims report losing their entire investments after being manipulated with fake promises of profits and blocked withdrawals.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Zonefundingfx.com is a Scam</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>‚ùå Zone Funding FX is not regulated by any official financial authority.</li>
    <li>‚ùå Misleading claims of guaranteed returns with no risk.</li>
    <li>‚ùå Fabricated account growth to trick users into depositing more funds.</li>
    <li>‚ùå Withdrawal requests are ignored or rejected without reason.</li>
    <li>‚ùå Numerous complaints and warnings from defrauded clients online.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This broker targets inexperienced traders and uses aggressive tactics to pressure them into making larger deposits. Once funds are transferred, communication often stops, or users are given excuses why their funds can't be withdrawn.
